      Endpoints are simply URLs which can be used to retrieve or change data stored on the server. Each endpoint consists of URL parameters and a handler (function) that receives these parameters validated (according to each endpoint's validation setup) and responds to the client. The quickest way to get the hang of endpoints is to :
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Create an endpoint using the form below. E.g. <code>GET /posts</code></li>
      <li>Setup some parameters and their validation.</li>
      <li>SAVE the setup and head to the /main.js file of this server for straight examples of coding handlers.</li>
    </ol>
