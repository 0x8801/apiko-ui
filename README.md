> Apiko developer UI.

## About

The general idea for Apiko is to have a backend REST API tool that will help you to setup a backend server as easily as possible.

Ideally, you would only have to code the URL handler functions themselves. Apiko should give you an interface to easily :

1) manage database collections 
2) manage endpoint urls and their parameters (and apiko server would validate the parameters according to your setup)
3) manage access rights 
4) create documentation for your API for other developers

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
